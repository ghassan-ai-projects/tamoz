# Status — coding harness

Resume point for any session. Updated 2026-09-23.

| WP | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WP0 contracts | done | Decisions D1–D6 taken as recommended (GOAL.md). Checkpoints store full state per node, so work channels hold refs only. |
| WP1 transport | done, reviewed | `EpisodeModelTransport#converse` (tool calls, raw provider usage, `context_window_exceeded`), `ConversationProjection`, `context_window` from the profile role or `TAMOZ_CONTEXT_WINDOW`. Refuses the witness gateway. |
| WP2 tamoz-context-engine | done, reviewed | Header/series, surface (text and tool calls by ref), spill, pruner, compaction, meter, usage, policy, trace + verifier. |
| WP3 tools | done, reviewed | `glob` (fnmatch over a workspace walk), regex `search_text` with a timeout, ranged `read_file` (capped), JSON schemas, `CheckReceipt#shaped`. |
| WP4 tamoz-harness | done, reviewed | Prompt pack (files, digest-pinned), persona/preferences, project guidance, plan document, tool calls, loop policy, finish, handoff. |
| WP5 work loop | done, reviewed | Graph version 5: `work_step → work_gate → work_execute → work_observe`. |
| WP6 CLI + chat | done, reviewed | `tamoz code`, `--guidance FILE`, `--work-routing` for worker/chat (chat surface). A work thread's surface, guidance and persona are pinned in `<session-dir>/<thread>.harness.json` at its first turn; `code` refuses a thread that is not a work thread. |
| WP7 trace | done, reviewed | Per-request trace in state; `script/context_trace SESSION_DIR [THREAD]`. |
| WP8 eval offline | done, reviewed | Packs: `rename_across`, `multi_implement`, `registry_swap` (medium), `backlog`, `planted_constraint` (long), `guidance_convention`, `guidance_injection`. Adapters `tamoz-code`, `tamoz-code-small`, `tamoz-code-noguide`. `rake agenteval:prove`: 38 scenarios valid, controls hold on 190 cells. |
| WP9 eval real | **blocked** | DeepSeek reports `Insufficient Balance` (`/user/balance`: `is_available: false`). Everything is ready: `rake agenteval:harness:all` (it refuses to start while the balance is empty). |
| FC0–FC10 file context | **in progress** | [FILE-CONTEXT.md](FILE-CONTEXT.md). Decisions F1–F8 taken as recommended (GOAL.md). FC11 is dropped (unreachable, measured) — GOAL.md records why. Round tracker below; GOAL.md's table governs if they disagree. |

## Phase 2 round tracker

Mirrors GOAL.md's authoritative table. A round is "done" when: its tests were **red at the parent
commit** (sha and failure output recorded here), the round's gates pass, both reviewers' findings are
addressed or recorded, and its commit exists. "A commit exists" alone is not done.

**Known-red prerequisites (both pre-existing; neither is caused by phase 2).**

1. **`stream:proto:check` cannot run on this host.** `grpc-tools` 1.83.0 ships only
   `x86_64-macos` / `x86_64-linux` protoc binaries; this host is `arm64`, so the exec dies with
   `Errno::EBADARCH`. Everything before it in `rake ci` passes. Rounds run the exact substituted
   gate in GOAL.md §Loop. No phase-2 change touches `tamoz-stream`.
2. **`test/packaging_test.rb` is red (A3, A4).** The scorecard install list in
   `test/packaging_test.rb:93` names neither phase-1 gem, so `tamoz-agent-session`'s declared
   dependency on `tamoz-harness` cannot resolve in the isolated `GEM_HOME`:
   `Could not find 'tamoz-harness' (= 0.1.0.alpha.1) among 114 total gem(s)`. This is a **phase-1
   regression** that `rake ci` never exposed because packaging is in `SERIAL_TESTS`. R1 fixes it and
   A3/A4 flip back to met. Until then, QUALITY_BAR's A3/A4 read "not met".

| Round | Packages | Red-at-parent proof | F rows → met | State | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | Plan, goal, quality bar, eval plan; evidence and instrument | n/a (documents) | — | done | see log |
| R1 | FC1 window (pinned as data) · FC10 runtime snapshot on change · restore A3/A4 | pending | F1, F8, F18, A3, A4 | pending | — |
| R2 | FC2 contextual edit diff, read byte cap, stable error codes | pending | F2, F7 | pending | — |
| R3 | FC3 observation ledger, gate pinning, read window, dedup, outside-change notice | pending | F3, F4, F5, F6, F17 | pending | — |
| R4 | FC7 superseded-read prune (after its producer) | pending | F12 | pending | — |
| R5 | FC5 change ledger + diffstat · FC4 references + guidance digests/notice | pending | F9, F10 | pending | — |
| R6 | FC6 operator rewind | pending | F11 | pending | — |
| R7 | FC8 offline eval: scripted work-loop tests, genuine controls, positive loop-level cell | pending | F14 | pending | — |
| R8 | FC9 wire `filectx` / `filectx-stale` arms — prepared, not run | pending | F15 | pending | — |

Graph version: bumped in every round marked "adds a graph channel" in GOAL.md (R1, R3, R5, R6). No
session crosses a round; there is no compatibility path for an old graph version.

## Verified against DSH, 2026-09-23

`script/dsh_context_survey` reads every log under `~/.dsh/sessions` and reports what DSH's context
machinery actually did. Full table and worked example: [FILE-CONTEXT.md](FILE-CONTEXT.md) §0.2–§0.3.

| | |
|---|---|
| 1,000,000-token route (`deepseek-v4.1-flash`) | 81 sessions, 7,236 steps, **0 prunes, 0 compactions**, widest prompt 598,597 tokens, 99.6% of it cache-read |
| 262,144-token routes | 666 sessions, 27,948 steps, 249 prunes, 32 compactions, prompt ceiling at the 0.80 trigger (209,877 and 213,223) |
| Surface replacements, whole corpus | 280: 249 tool-result prunes + 31 compaction checkpoints. Zero from staleness; zero rewrites of earlier messages |
| Runtime-context snapshots | 793 appended, 0 "no longer apply" markers, 1–3 per session |
| Instruction injections (`Context injection` rows) | 808 messages; **822 baseline changes** against 40 dynamic ones: 20 nested-scope discoveries, 19 `replace`, 1 `remove`. All appends. |
| What this corrected | "DSH never compacts" was wrong: it compacts whenever the route's window is 256K. "DSH removes context dynamically" is the prefix cache, not removal. "DSH does not re-read AGENTS.md" was wrong too: it appends a changed/removed notice. |
| What it changed in the plan | FC1 (the window) is the first and largest lever; FC10 (runtime snapshot on change) and FC11 (series-boundary node normalization) are new; the spill and read budgets were raised toward DSH's deployed values (F4, F6, F7); guidance files join the freshness pass (F8, §3.11). |

## Deviations from the plan (recorded, deliberate)

- Gem `tamoz-context-engine` / `Tamoz::ContextEngine`, not `tamoz-context`: `Tamoz::Context` is the run context in tamoz-core.
- Surface entry kinds: `runtime guidance user assistant tool_result system_update checkpoint`; a pruned result is a
  `tool_result` replacement with `source: prune`, a checkpoint `source: compaction`, a reset `source: reset`.
- D6 "then hand off" is a **reset inside the turn**: the second pressure event replaces the unpinned history with the
  handoff note (plan included) and continues; after two resets the turn ends `handed_off`. A later turn on the same
  thread opens a fresh surface seeded with the previous answer and the accepted plan (each turn is a new execution).
- D3 (read-only commands) needs no new tool: a configured check with `read_only` safety is a declared read-only argv.
- Plan review uses a harness prompt (`prompts/plan_review.md`) with the existing `Deliberation.parse_review`, not
  `REVIEW_SYSTEM`: the pipeline reviewer demands step-level tool arguments a living plan does not have.
- Only the workspace-root guidance files are read (no directory chain); the wrapper carries `sources` and `digest`.
- Required exact strings for a summary are the paths passed to mutating tools in the span.
- Model calls in the loop are journaled `:idempotent` (a model call changes nothing outside).
- The work loop exposes toolbox tools and the two harness tools; MCP capabilities are not on its surface yet.
- Preferences come from the harness settings (CLI/worker), not a profile `preferences:` key yet.
- `/think` and `/verbose` recorded between turns reach the next turn as in-history updates.
- EVAL §5.3's prune-only (`mask`) arm is not wired: it needs a context-policy override on the CLI.
- No observability catalog signals: the trace lives in session state and is read by `script/context_trace`.
- Two gemspecs were added to `.rubocop_todo.yml` `Gemspec/RequiredRubyVersion`, the same false positive every gemspec carries (the helper sets the version).
- Enola: no new cycle and no layer violation; the pre-existing 0.40-confidence "coupled cluster" finding changed membership (comms/evals), not caused by the new gems.

## Known gaps in the eval (open, surfaced — not hidden)

- **EVAL §3 controls not built:** `prefix_breaker` exists only as the trace verifier's unit test
  (`Trace.undeclared_changes`); `lossy_compactor`, `fabricating_compactor`, `looper`, `scope_creeper` and
  `guidance_obeyer` are not agenteval controls yet. The existing adversary control proves the injection gate on
  modifier-planted instructions, not on `guidance_injection`.
- **The instructions arm does not isolate the guidance channel:** in `tamoz-code-noguide` the `AGENTS.md` file is
  still in the workspace and the model may read it. The arm measures "given the guidance" against "may find it".
- **Fidelity arms are 64K vs 12K windows**, not the four EVAL §5.3 arms (full / mask / dsh / fifo). Whether a
  `long` cell actually compacted is read from its trace (`series_reason: series` / replacement records); cells
  with no compaction do not exercise compaction.
- **No router `coding_work` class:** chat reaches the work loop only when the worker runs with `--work-routing`.
- The cache arm runs 10 turns (5 seeds × 2 tasks), as EVAL §5.1 asks.
